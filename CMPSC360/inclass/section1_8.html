        3 = 2 + 1; constructive.

        The propostion, if a, b are rational then a<sup>b</sup> is rational, is false. Let a = 2, and b = 1/2.

        Uniqueness proof:<br>
        ASSUME: a, b, and c are real and a <font face="symbol">&#8800;</font> 0.<br>
        SUPPOSE: there are two distinct solutions, d and e, for x in the equation ax + b = c.<br>
        SHOW: d = e.<br>
        ad + b = c and ae + b = c, by the supposition, then<br>
        ad + b = ae + b, as they both equal c, and<br>
        ad = ae, subtracting b from both sides, and<br>
        d = e, dividing both sides by a.
        </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>30.
        <p>
        SHOW: there are no integers x, y, such that 2x<sup>2</sup> + 5y<sup>2</sup> = 14.<br>
        Proof by cases; in each case we show the imposibility of BOTH x and y being integers.<br>
        Focusing on y, we see that |y| must be < 2, as 5(2<sup>2</sup>) = 5((-2)<sup>2</sup>) and both are 20 which is > 14. Hence y can only be -1, 0, or 1.<br><br>
        Case 1: y is 1, then<br>
        2x<sup>2</sup> + 5 = 14, or<br>
        2x<sup>2</sup> = 9, and<br>
        x<sup>2</sup> = 9/2<br>
        which is impossible because the square of no integer is 9/2.<br><br>
        Case 2: y = 0, then<br>
        2x<sup>2</sup> = 14, and<br>
        x<sup>2</sup> = 7, and <br>
        this is also impossible as the square of no integer is 7.<br><br>
        Case 3: y = -1; this case is similar to Case 1.<br><br>
