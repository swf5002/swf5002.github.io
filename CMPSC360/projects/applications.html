			  First come first serve.

			</li>

			<!--li>

			  You may also submit, along with your choices of topics, two names of your classmates who you

		      would like to work with on this project.

			<li>The instructor will determine your final topic<!-- and the members of your team-->.</li>

			<!--li>

			  After the teams have been determined, each team must formulate a contract (see the folder on

		      General Instructions) by the following week signed by the members of the team.

			<li> 

    		  You have the rest of the semester to conduct a thorough research on the applicability of your topic. &#160; 

		      Applications may be in any or all of the areas of hardware, software, integration of hardware and software, 

			  management and dissemination of information, etc. &#160;

    	      How is your discrete mathematics topic applied in the field of technology?

			</li>

			<li>

              Prepare and submit a paper (Times New Roman font, 12 pt., double-spaced lines). &#160;

     		  Prepare to give a brief presentation (about 20 minutes) of your report in class towards the end of the 

			  semester. &#160;
